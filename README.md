Lung Cancer Prediction final-project
INTRODUCTION:
 A cancer that begins in the lungs and most often occurs in people who smoke.
Two major types of lung cancer are non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer. Causes of lung cancer include smoking, second-hand smoke, exposure to certain toxins and family history.
Symptoms include a cough (often with blood), chest pain, wheezing and weight loss. These symptoms often don't appear until the cancer is advanced.
Treatments vary but may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted drug therapy and immunotherapy.
Lung cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the lungs. The lungs are two spongy organs in your chest that take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women. Each year, more people die of lung cancer than of colon, breast, and prostate cancers combined.Lung cancer is caused by smoking cigarettes, breathing in secondhand smoke, and exposure to certain chemicals and radon gas. The main cause of lung cancer is smoking cigarettes. If you smoke, the best way to reduce your risk of lung cancer is to quit smoking.

In this project we have clean the data and applied EDA after that we emplimented the machine algorithms and some of the model to it..and we had found highest accuracy for lung cancer prediction

aim:to find the lung cancer prediction

software used:anaconda

tools:jyupter notebook

library used:
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn

conclusio:
 In Earlier times for detection of any type of Lung cancer
the doctor has to do multiple tests of patient. But this was
very time consuming process to get clarify whether the
patient is have lung cancer or other type of disease. In a
research sometimes patient have to do unnecessary
checkups or different tests to identify the disease of lung
cancer. To minimize the process time and unnecessary
checkups there needs to be a one preliminary test in which
patient and doctor both will get clarify with the
possibilities of lung cancer. Nowadays the machine
learning algorithms plays a vital role in prediction and
classification of data. KNN,random forest,Adaptive boost,Decision tree,are the
most popular algorithms available in the machine
learning.
    
   overall Random forest has 100% accuracy
